Parts Overview
==============

The parts of the machine are organized in 5 groups:

* Memory unit
* Adder unit
* Napier unit
* Side walls
* Miscellaneous and optional parts

The three units and the side walls should be made from 3.2mm birch plywood.
The bill of materials src/BOM.txt lists all needed raw material.
Most important are three boards of plywood 76cm x 50cm. All lasercut parts are made from these.

When buying the wood, please make sure it is max 3.2mm thick. Some vendors sell up to 3.5mm thick boards when asked for 3mm (this will not work!). Other vendors can do exact 3.0mm (this works, but needs much glue). With 3.2mm many connections are nice press fits, and need very little glue.
Birch is available in good qualities. You want no gnarls or knots, but smooth and perfectly flat boards.
Ask for "laser quality". The grain must run parallel to the long side of the boards. (Wodden springs do not work when cut crosswise to the grain!)

Beech is also a good choice. It is much harder, but also more expensive.
Do not use inexpensive poplar or cottonwood. It is too soft for cutting gears.

Lasercut the three files schickard_napiers.svg, schickard_adder.svg and schickard_memory.svg found in the src folder.
In each of these, a layer named 'laser' should be visible, representing one board 76cm x 50cm each. These three boards represent the entire machine. All other files are optional or contain construction sketches that were used to produced the three schickard_*.svg files.

The following is a description what is contained in these boards. It is best to keep the parts well sorted according to the unit they belong to. You can lasercut one board at a time and assemble one unit of the machine, if you start in the order given here. Do the napier unit last, it needs all the parts left over from the other two boards.


Memory Unit
-----------
This unit is the simplest of all, it should be assembled first.
The memory unit is a flat box (ca. 33cm long, 3cm high, 7cm deep) at the bottom of the machine.
The top surface of the box has six knobs and six windows showing one digit each. To start multiplying, enter
one of the two number here by turning the knobs.
The bottom of the box as some openings to allow viewing the interior mechanism.

All parts of the memory unit are found on the left hand side of the file
schickard_memory.svg -- the right hand side of this 76cm x 50cm board contains one of the
side walls, and several parts for the napier unit.
Of one type of ring, there are 9 copies. Six are used for the memory unit, three belong to the napier unit.

Also in this board are 13 parts for positioning aids used during assembly. They are not part of the machine.

 * Locate five small 32mm x 14mm rectangles with a toothed cut out. They are labeled "Positioning Aid Knob Assembly". There are five more unlabled parts very similar to the labeled ones. (Only four of each are needed, there are five incase you break or loose one.)
 * Locate two angled pieces with an inner curve ca. 6cm x 5cm. They are labeled "Napier - Positioning Aid Side Connectors". Put them aside, they are used later when assembling the side walls.
 * Locate one rectanglare piece ca. 7cm x 3cm. It is labeled "Positioning Aid Side Connectors Memory". Put it aside, it is used later when assembling the side walls.

Also on this board are two sets of rings.
The set on the bottom edge has 14.4mm outer diameter, the set on the right hand edge has 14.3mm. Use the set that fits best, discard the other. Optionally use rings from a stronger material like e.g. Kraftplex.
Put them aside, they are used later with the adder and napier units.


Adder Unit
----------
The adder unit is a box (ca. 33cm x 8cm x 8cm) in the center of the machine. It has six wheels with knobs on its front, each wheel has 10 holes that can be operated with a 6mm rod or the end of a pen.
The top surface features six windows, where the result is displayed.
The box has no bottom and the back wall has many openings to allow a good view on the most complex part of the machine: the gears. This mechanism performs correct carry-over to neigbouring digits.
[Wilhelm Schickard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Schickard) was most likely the first to design and document such a mechanism.

The result of all computations are displayed in this unit. To start multiplying, turn the wheels so that 000000 is displayed.

All parts fit on schickard_adder.svg using ca. two third of a 76 x 50 board. The right hand third of this file contains one set of side wall parts, and three sets of shafts for the napier drums.

Also on this board are 12 parts that positioning aids used during assembly. They are not part of the machine.

* Locate five small 32mm x 14mm rectangles with a toothed cut out. They are labeled "Positioning Aid Knob Assembly". There are five more unlabled parts very similar to the labeled ones. You can re-use the knob assembly aids from the memory unit and discard these 10 parts found here.
* Locate two rectangles ca 11cm x 5cm labeled "Positioning Aid Carry Wheels".

All knobs are identical. We need a total of 18 knobs.

The knobs for the adder unit are mounted on 10-hole disks. The disks have the '0' position marked with a small notch.
The digit drums consist of one toothed ring, a disk and 10 number-pads. Ring and disk have their '0' position marked with a rectangle.
The shafts are composed of three parts, glued together to form a cross. There are two sets of shaft parts, labeled "1, 100, 10.000" and "10, 1.000, 100.000"
All gears and spacer squares are pushed onto the shafts from the rear end. The labels face rear.
The large 10-tooth-gears have their '0' position marked with a line.

Parts are pushed onto the shafts in the following order:

3 shafts "1, 100, 10.000":
  * first 2x one-tooth,
  * then 4x spacer square,
  * then 2x 10-tooth-gear.

3 shafts "10, 1.000, 100.000":
  * first 2x 10-tooth-gear,
  * then 4x spacer square,
  * then 2x one-tooth.

Each of these parts has two holes for toothpicks. These holes face to the left and are toothpicks are used to align the parts precisely.

The five carry shafts are 6mm diameter beechwood, 90mm long. The back wall lables them A, B, C, D, E.
For A, C, E and B, D respectively find a "Positioning Aid Carry Wheels". The openings fit the wheels or rings for each position.
Two toothpicks are used here too for precise alignment.
The last ring mounts the shaft into the back wall of the adder unit, as indicated on the positioning aids.

Napier Unit
-----------
This is the upper part of the machine, where multiplications are done. It is named after [John Napier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Napier "Wikipedia Article on John Napier"), who invented the "[Napier's Bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napier%27s_bones)" giving the layout of the numbers on the drums.

The Napier unit consists of a box (ca. 33cm x 21cm x 6cm) with 6 drums standing upright. The back side of the box is open, to allow studying the interier,
the front has 8 sliders that can cover one row each of the multiplication table. Row "1" is always visible.
On the top are 6 knobs. To start multiplying, close all slides and enter one of the two numbers here by turing the knobs, so that it is shown in Row "1".

All parts for the box and most parts of the drums are in the schickard_napiers.svg file.
The layout fills one 76cm x 50 cm board. Two sets of napiers bones and several rings and shafts for the drums are
on the lower right hand side of the schickard_memory.svg. Three sets of shaft parts are on the right hand side
of schickard_adder.svg.


Side Walls
----------
The machine has a modular design. Each of the three units as its own enclosure. The left and right sides of the
machine are the two walls that hold the three modules in place. Each wall consits of two layer of plywood
 * the outer layer with only openings for the 8 slides,
 * the inner layer with openings for also the sides of the three units.

The memory unit is locked into the side walls using one connector on each side.
The napiers unit has two connectors (top and bottom) on each side.
The adder unit has none.

A wall connector is 30mm long, 6mm wide (two layers of plywood glued together), and in the middle 13mm high.
A rectanglar hole 4mm x 6mm goes across the connector.
Wall connectors are glued with their flat surface into the sidewalls. Their curved part extends into the sides of the memor or napier box. In this position a slim wedge can be inserted in to the hole of the connector locking the box in place.


Miscellaneous
-------------

The file schickard_misc_construction.svg has an additional set of rings (replacing the ones found in schickard_memory.svg). There are three different outer diameters 14.3mm, 14.4mm, and 14.5mm here. You can optionally cut these rings out of harder material like acrylic or kraftplex. The rings server as bearings for the shafts of napier and adder unit.

The file schickard_sign.svg has a wooden sign with two feet, for display with the machine. The sign is optional, it is not a part of the machine. This is designed for a 4mm plywood board. The SVG file has multiple layers. You can
select english and german text by disabling/enabling layers using inkscape.

There are also arrays of red lines, 90mm apart and 13mm apart. These can be used to cut the needed 4mm and 6mm
shafts from beech wood rods with a lasercutter.



Laser Settings
==============
To cut the parts from the boards you need access to a laser cutter with a bed of at least 76cm x 50cm size.
Find a machine large enough at your nearest FabLab or hacker space.
A machine with ca. 60-80 Watts is recommended. Expect ca. two hours cutting time and another two hours handling time
for collecting the parts from the machine and sort them into suitable containers. In total, there are ca. 600 parts.

The source files are are SVG format. These files can be processed with VisiCut (or converted with inkscape to PDF or other formats needed for your laser machine). Please re-check the dimensions (76 x 50) of the drawings after conversion.

The line colors (stroke or outline color) used in the SVG files have different meaning.

 * Red. These lines cut through the board. (E.g an 80W Thunderlaser may use speed 30, power 70/50 to cut through 3mm birchwood.)
 * Green. These lines are superficial markings. (E.g an 80W Thunderlaser may use speed 200, power 8/35 on birchwood.)
   Engraving mode (rasterization) may also work for green, but is not recommended, as it may be much slower.
 * Blue and other colors (if any) are to be ignored.

Several different fill colors were used during constructions, some parts have no fill.
These colors have no meaning for laser cutting.
Line width (stroke thickness) is typically 0.1 or 0.2mm. This also has no meaning for laser cutting.

Expect that some of the smaller parts may fall through the grid of the laser bed. It is recomended to clean any previous waste from the machine before starting. Most of the smaller parts come larger numbers than actually needed to save you from collecting each and every dropped piece.

A large table surface helps to keep the parts arranged into small piles. If needed, use containers like cardboard boxes or transparent zip bags for handling the parts between cutting and assembly.
