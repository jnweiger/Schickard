Grease before assembly
======================
All moving parts should be rubbed with wax. The stump of an old candle works fine for that
purpose. Especially take the time to

1) apply wax to all faces of the the small rollers at the tips of the springs.
2) apply wax to all teeth of each gear.

Apply very little wax to the sliders. It okay for them to 
have some friction, as there are no springs to hold them in position.

After assembly, if you find that some knobs turn harder than others or make unusual noise, 
you may re-apply some wax. It may be needed to open the neper drum box and the memory unit to access
the interior, for the adder unit, the tip of a small knive (carrying some wax) should help to reach all parts.
There should be no grinding or creaking noise from the machine. Only the clicking of the springs
when a digit snaps into position.


Adjustment of the adder unit after assembly
===========================================

There is one long tooth per wheel that engages in its left
neighbour to perform a carry over.
This happens, when the wheel is turned clockwise from 9 to 0 (addition) 
and also when turning counter clockwise from 0 to 9 (subtraction).
This tooth engages only in betwwen the 0 and 9 positions.
It must not be engaged when the wheel sits in the 0 or 9 position.
The wheel left to it must rotate freely in both cases.

To achieve this setting, the wooden spring at the back of the adder unit can be moved 
sideways by 2mm.

1) Start by moving the spring centered, so that there 1 mm travel to either side.
2) Turn the wheels of the adder unit until it displays 9 9 9 9 9 9.
3) flip the machine over and find the one long tooth on each wheel of the adder unit.
4) Looking at the back of the adder unit, each long tooth should point south-east
   and should be ca 0.5mm away from the neighbouring gear. 
   The gap can be seen best when looking into the adder unit from the bottom.
   Cut small strip from a business card, it should easily slide between tooth and gear.
5) If they are too far away, push the spring a fraction of a millimeter leftwards. The gap gets smaller.
6) If they touch or engage the gear, push the sping rightward until they don't.
7) Turn the wheels of the adder unit until it displays 0 0 0 0 0 0.
   If perfectly turned, turing the rightmost (unit) wheel clockwise should turn all wheels.
   Initially, it may be very hard to do so. Turn the unit wheel rightward, until you see the
   thenths, hundreds, and thousands wheel move just a tiny bit. To complete the movement at the unit wheel, 
   help with your other hands gently at the thousands wheel.
   If that works, the unit is tuned 'good enough'.
   If the mechanism blocks, turn each wheel individually counter-clockwise all the way from 9 to 0.
8) flip the machine over again and find the one long tooth on each wheel. It is now a bit higher into the
   mechanism pointing east-shouth-east.
9) Again, each long tooth should not be engaged. It should be away from the gear the same amount 
   as it was on the first place.
10) If needed, adjust the spring, then apply some glue near the pins to lock the spring in the 
   best position.
11) In case there is no spring position for all long teeth to be free simultaneously in both (0 and 9) positions, 
   gently apply a small file to remove material from the long teeth.


All wheels should now rotate freely, regardless of their neighbours position.
During addition the wheels should never block. It may occasionally happen during subtraction, 
that a wheel blocks when its right neighbour shows 0. Unblock the wheel by holding back its 
right neighbor by a small amount. If that happens too often, check the alignment of the spring, 
and re-adjust according the above procedure.  The wooden construction is sensitive to changes in 
temperature and humitdity, or may simply develop more slack over time.
